A. Customer Experience Analysis:

increasing or decreasing over time? 
‚ùñ Efficiency & Service Gaps: What is the average resolution time for resolved complaints? Which 
complaint type takes the longest to resolve, indicating a potential process gap? 
‚ùñ The Backlog: How many complaints are still Open or In Progress? This is a key 
performance metric for the customer service team.

Retail)? From a specific region?
‚ùñ High-Value Customers: Are our most valuable customers (from Week 2: high balance) experiencing 
more issues? This is a retention risk. 

C. Risk & Fraud Analysis: 
‚ùñ Exposure: How many active (Open, In Progress) fraud cases do we have? What is the total count of

‚ùñ Urgency: Create a priority system to flag high-risk complaints for immediate action (e.g., all "Open" 
fraud cases older than 7 days).
